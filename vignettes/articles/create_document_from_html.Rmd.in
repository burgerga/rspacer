title: "Tutorial: creating a document from html"
---

## Before you start

In this tutorial, we describe how to create an RSpace structured document from a
Quarto file using `document_create_from_html()`. We advice you to read `vignette("rspacer")` to
make sure that you are ready to use this upload document. You need to install
rspacer and set up your API url and API key before the start of this tutorial.

## Load R libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rspacer)
```

## Check if the API is available

This code checks if the API is available. The API status should be OK.

```{r}
(res <- api_status())
stopifnot(res$message == "OK")
```

## Create a structured document in RSpace

Create a Template from a Form with four text Fields named "Title", "Date", "Main
part" and "Conclusion". Write down the unique Structured Document identifier,
you will need it later. Instructions to design a Template in RSpace can be found
[here](https://documentation.researchspace.com/article/wxfk9gf0a0-templates).

## Create a small example document

1.  The rspacer package has an example file. In RStudio, go to File \> New File
    \> R Markdown. At the moment (2025-02-06) there is not yet an option to
    create Quarto files from template, which is why we chose to provide the file
    as an R Markdown template.
2.  On the left, click From Template.
3.  Choose the rspacer Template example. Save the file as a Quarto file (`.qmd`).
4.  Render the file to a html report.

Alternatively, you can create a new Quarto document. Include the same headers as
the RSpace Template that you previously created, and make sure that
these headers all have two hashtags (h2 headers, with `##`). You can write any
code, or use h3 or h4 headers (with three or four hashtags), as long the h2
headers are identical to your structured document template.

## Specify the file name of the file to upload

rspacer needs to know which file you want to upload. In this tutorial, we want
to create a structured document from the file `Template_example.html` that we
created before, and we want to upload the `.qmd` file as an attachment.
We recommend to work with relative paths from within an R project (you can
specify these using the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/).
If this is not what you want, you need to specify the absolute file path.
The code below assumes that the html file and qmd file have the same filename.
If this is not the case, change both the `file_name` and the
`matching_code_file` variables.

```{r}
(file_name <- system.file("Template_example.html", package = "rspacer"))
(matching_code_file <- fs::path_ext_set(file_name, ".qmd"))
stopifnot(file.exists(file_name))
stopifnot(file.exists(matching_code_file))
```

### Upload the file

To upload the document and attachment to the API inbox, this code chunk is
sufficient:

```{r}
document_create_from_html(
    path = file_name,
    template_id = template_id
)
```

However, `document_create_from_html()` has more parameters, in case you want to,
for example, upload the file to a specific folder or replace an existing
document (click the function above to learn more).

How to find the values for these parameters? Browse your RSpace folders using
`folder_tree()` and use either the `id` or the `globalID`. Folder identifiers
start with `FL`, notebook identifiers start with `NB`, structured document
identifiers start with `SD`. For example:

```{r}
folder_tree()
folder_tree("FL7833")
```

Of course you can also find these by going to the web interface of your RSpace instance.
You can also tag your documents using a `tags` vector, for example a status like
"finished" or "in progress" or "failed".
Finally, you can upload attachments, these need to be specified using list of lists, with the field number and the path of the file that needs to be
attached to that field.
An example where we also upload the source `.qmd` file is provided below.

```{r}
document_create_from_html(
  path = file_name,
  template_id = "SD377682",
  folder_id = "FL242398",
  tags = c("tutorial"),
  attachment = tibble(field = 3, path = matching_code_file),
  existing_document_id = NULL
)
```
